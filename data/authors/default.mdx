My name is Nicol, and I'm a passionate technology enthusiast
currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of
Milano-Bicocca. I was born in Rome then I continued my studies in Milan, Italy, and from a young age, I
had a natural inclination towards the world of technology and computers.

aFriendlyCracker is a project born out of my hobby and passion for sharing knowledge.
It's a platform where I discuss the latest developments, interesting tidbits, and not just
about the world of computer science.

The aim of this project is to create a space where people can explore and learn about
various facets of technology, not only from a technical standpoint but also from a broader
perspective that includes the impact of technology on our daily lives, society, and culture.
